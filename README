Script to use Greenhills Multi as C/C++ compiler from vim with ':make <project_build_file>'.
Sets compiler and errorformat for use with quickfix commands.
Needs a tool ('catch', not supported) on NT4 to catch stderr and stdout in my environment.
(Probably not necessary under Unix).

Does not catch all error and warning formats (especially. no linker problems).
